- **Features**:
  - In-memory caching for payment data
  - Configurable TTL (Time To Live)
  - Automatic cache cleanup
  - Cache statistics and monitoring
  - Cached API responses to reduce server load

### Cache Keys:
- `payment_data_{id}` - Payment link data (5 minutes TTL)
- `verification_{txid}` - Verification status
- `exchange_rates` - Currency exchange rates
- `bank_details_{currency}` - Bank account details

## 🌐 Offline Support & PWA Features

### Service Worker
- **Location**: `public/sw.js`, `lib/utils/service-worker.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Offline page caching
  - API response caching with network-first strategy
  - Background sync for failed transactions
  - Push notification support
  - Automatic cache management

### PWA Capabilities:
- Offline payment page access
- Background transaction retry
- Push notifications for payment status
- Standalone app mode detection
- Online/offline status monitoring

### Background Sync:
- Failed transaction recording retry
- Automatic retry when connection is restored
- Local storage of failed requests
- User notification of sync status

```

### Integration Points:
- **Main Payment Page**: `app/payment/[id]/page.tsx`
  - Integrates all advanced features
  - Performance monitoring throughout payment flow
  - Error handling and reporting
  - Offline support and caching

- **Layout**: `app/layout.tsx`
  - Global error boundary wrapper
  - Service worker registration

## 🚀 Production Considerations

### External Service Integration:
1. **Analytics**: Replace localStorage with services like Google Analytics, Mixpanel
2. **Error Reporting**: Integrate with Sentry, Bugsnag, or similar services
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Use services like New Relic, DataDog
4. **Push Notifications**: Implement with Firebase Cloud Messaging or similar

### Security Enhancements:
1. **CSRF Protection**: Implement server-side CSRF token validation
2. **Rate Limiting**: Add server-side rate limiting
3. **Input Validation**: Server-side validation mirrors client-side rules
4. **Session Security**: Use secure, HTTP-only cookies for session management

### Performance Optimizations:
1. **CDN**: Serve static assets from CDN
2. **Image Optimization**: Implement next/image for optimized loading
3. **Bundle Analysis**: Regular bundle size monitoring
4. **Database Caching**: Implement Redis or similar for API response caching

## 📈 Monitoring & Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators:
- Page load time
- Payment completion rate
- Error rate by type
- Cache hit ratio
- Offline usage statistics
- User session duration

### Health Checks:
- Service worker registration success
- Cache performance
- Error boundary triggers
- Background sync success rate

## 🔄 Maintenance

### Regular Tasks:
1. **Cache Cleanup**: Automatic every 10 minutes
2. **Error Log Review**: Monitor error patterns
3. **Performance Metrics**: Weekly performance reviews
4. **Security Updates**: Regular dependency updates

### Monitoring Alerts:
- High error rates
- Performance degradation
- Cache failures
- Service worker issues

This implementation provides a robust, production-ready payment system with enterprise-level features for security, performance, and user experience.
